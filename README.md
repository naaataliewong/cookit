# CooKit - Cooking Recipe App ü•ó

Our goal in creating this app was to provide a one-stop place where users could find their desired recipe without having to go through multiple websites, which may be  time consuming. With the CooKit app, users can have a recipe library in his/her pocket to access at any time and from anywhere.
